# Walmart_Sales_DataAnalysis

![walmart_project_with_gradient_bg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba30c099-281b-4713-b92e-e7e8cc5112e1)

This project offers a comprehensive solution to analyze Walmart sales data using Python and SQL. It is designed to address key business questions and extract actionable insights through structured data analysis, cleaning, and querying techniques. The project is an excellent opportunity for data analysts to enhance their expertise in Python and SQL, including working with real-world data pipelines and advanced queries.

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, MySQL
   - **Goal**: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

### 2. Set Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain your Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in your local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Use the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into your project.

### 3. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
   - **Storage**: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

### 4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
   - **Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 5. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 6. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 7. Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 8. Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion. `df.to_sql(name='walmart_sales', con= engine_mysql, if_exists='append', index=False)`
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 9. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Indentifying the most frequently used payment method in each branch
```
select
  *
from
(select
	branch,
    payment_method,
    count(*) as total_transactions,
   rank() over(partition by branch order by count(*) desc) as ranking
from
	walmart_sales
    group by branch, payment_method) as tab
    where ranking = 1;
```
  - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
  - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
  - **Documentation**: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.
